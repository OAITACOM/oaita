OAITA is a fully offline AI chat system that runs entirely on your local machine.
It launches a lightweight local server and exposes a browser-based chat interface,
with no cloud services, no accounts, and no data leaving your computer.

This program will run on almost any windows 10+ PC without any installation or
technical knowledge needed. Plug in any GGUF model and it will auto-detect.

## Overview
OAITA delivers a fast, private, and fully offline AI chat experience through a modern browser interface.  
Launch once, and your default browser opens to a responsive chat window powered entirely by your local hardware.  
No internet connection is required, and no data ever leaves your machine.

## Key Features
- 🔒 **Fully offline** — all processing happens locally, ensuring privacy and security.
- ⚡ **Fast local inference** — responses generated instantly on your hardware.
- 🔄 **Multiple models** — Use the Mistral model included or download more models like LLaMA3 or Gemma from the website.
- 🌐 **LAN support** — optionally allow phones, tablets, or other devices on your local network to connect.
- 🖥️ **Browser-based interface** — chat from any modern browser without installing extra software.
- 🚀 **Automatic startup** — launch the EXE and your default browser opens straight to the admin panel.
- 📊 **Dynamic server info** — view active model, server address, and mode (Private or LAN) directly in the interface.

## How It Works
1. **Launch**: Open `oaita.exe`. 
2. **Choose a model**: Use the included model, or downloaded more models from the website.
3. **Start server**: OAITA starts a lightweight local web server and opens the chat interface in your browser.  
4. **Connect from other devices**: If LAN mode is enabled, open the displayed local IP on any device connected to your network.  
5. **Chat**: Type messages in the browser interface. The AI model processes them locally and returns responses.  
   *(Note: the first message may take longer as the model warms up.)*
