OAITA is a fully offline AI chat system that runs entirely on your local machine.
It launches a lightweight local server and exposes a browser-based chat interface,
with no cloud services, no accounts, and no data leaving your computer.

I made this program to run on almost any windows PC without any installation or
technical knowledge needed. Plug in any GGUF model and it will auto-detect.
